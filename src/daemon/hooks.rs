//! Win32 hook event handlers.
//!
//! This module contains individual handlers for each type of hook event:
//!
//! - [`on_window_created`] — handles new window creation
//! - [`on_window_destroyed`] — handles window destruction
//! - [`on_window_minimized`] — handles window minimize events
//! - [`on_window_restored`] — handles window restore (un-minimize) events
//! - [`on_focus_changed`] — handles focus changes
